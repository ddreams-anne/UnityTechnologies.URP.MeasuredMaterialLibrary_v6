# Measured Material Library for the Universal Render Pipeline

This is a Unity Project showcasing the Measured Material Library for the Universal Render Pipeline.
It is an upgrade from the original library by Unity Technologies at [github.com/Unity-Technologies/MeasuredMaterialLibraryURP](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/MeasuredMaterialLibraryURP), which was created for Unity 2019.

## Instructions
Open the project with Unity 6000.0.0f1 or higher.
Go to the Material Samples folder to see samples of all available materials.

## Last known working version
Verified in Unity 6000.0.7f1 using URP 17.0.3.

NOTE: This project still needs some more refactoring, which should be ready (way) before the first Unity LTS version.
      Once the first LTS version becomes available, that will become the lowest verified version of this project.
